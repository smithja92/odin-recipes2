        <body>I STILL NEED TO INSERT A DESCRIPTION HERE</body>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <body>The follow items are what one needs in order to prepare a peanut 
            butter and jelly sandwich. You can use whatever ingredients you want,
            but do not deviate from this list. Seriously, don't do it.
        </body>

        <ul><strong>- Peanut Butter</strong> is the first part
            in the name and therefore the most important ingredient.
            You can choose whatever kind you like as long as its creamy
            and its the right brand. What's the right brand? Well, as the 
            saying goes, "Choosy moms chooose JIF." Well, my mom choosy
            chooses Skippy. You definitely want Skippy.
            <br>
            <br><strong>- Jelly</strong> is the next most important ingredient.
            Theres really no debate here. You will get Smucker's strawberry
            jam. Anything else and you may as well throw the whole sandwich
            away.
            <br>
            <br><strong>- Bread</strong> is the foundation of the sandwich.
            It decides where this story begins and ends. You absolutely want fresh,
            never frozen. I prefer whole wheat, but you can take some liberties
            here. Either way, make sure it is made without mango starch.
            <br>
            <br><strong>- Knives</strong> are necessary. Yes, thats a plural. Most everything else is self-explanatory 
            as far as what utensils and kitchenwarew to utilize. However
            this item requires special note because it is so often overlooked. YOU
            NEED THREE KNIVES. Anything less is barbaric. Let me explain: Peanut
            Butter, Jam, Slice. Need I say more? Who really wants to open up their
            jam and find a brown streak sliding down the center of the sugary
            sweetness. The inverse would be cataclysmic too. For the slicing
            it is well known that clean edges are necessary for the optical
            pleasure of consuming a legume paste and fruit coagulate layer loaf.
        </ul>
